# Introduction

Effective supply chain management is an integral part of many businesses and essential to business success, customer satisfaction, and operational costs management. 
The goal of a supply chain is to have an item in stock when a customer is ready to purchase the item, in the cheapest and fastest means possible.

One of the common problems in supply chain management is the complexity associated with predicting backorder. Luckily with the current data growth and advances in predictive analytics and artificial intelligence, machine learning could rescue supply chain managers from this daunting task.

In this project, I demonstrate using powerful python open source libraries and packages (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras) to build a model that predicts items that are more likely to backorder given some input features.

Once satisfied with the model results, Iâ€™ll deploy the predictive solution as a web service through Heroku, a Platform as a Service (PaaS) application, where any user will be able to input required item features and receive a prediction whether that item is or is not likely to backorder within the next eight weeks.
